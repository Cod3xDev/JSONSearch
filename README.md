## Description

JsonSearch is a simple console application that allows you to search for a specific text within JSON files in a given directory and its subdirectories.

## Usage

To use JsonSearch, follow these steps:

1. Open a command prompt or terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where the `JsonSearch` executable is located.
3. Run the following command:

JsonSearch <searchDirectory> <searchString>

Replace `<searchDirectory>` with the directory path where you want to search for JSON files, and `<searchString>` with the text you want to search for.

For example, to search for the text "example" within JSON files in the "data" directory, you would run:

Make sure to include any necessary quotation marks or escape characters if your directory or search string contains spaces or special characters.
